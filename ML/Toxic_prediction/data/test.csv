Qwyrxian, you were quite objective in your point1, but may not be so in your point2 except US and UK nautical charts that you mentioned and Oda Mari provided the links in the """"NPOV side"""" above. As saying """"international almanacs ... all without exception use Senkaku Islands"""", this is wrong. The documentary year book with which I found that """"Diaoyu Islands"""" but no """"Senkaku Islands"""" was used by SG of the UN in his official letter is an international almanac, named """"International Organizations and the Law of the Sea: Documentary Yearbook 1996"""" of """"NILOS Documentary Yearbook"""". It is for collection of related documents from the United Nations system. Therefore, this is a very high, if not the highest, quality of year book or almanac. Another UN document a UN General Assembly document can be found in page 85 of this year book, which mentioned """"D"""" and """"S"""" as follows:""""Since the 1970s, China and Japan have continued to dispute sovereignty over a group of five islets and barren rocks, known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, ..."""". And for encyclopedias, I checked Britannica, neither """"Senkaku Islands"""" nor """"Diaoyu Islands"""" can be found . When you asserted """"all"""" Encyclopedias, """"all"""" almanacs, can you list all of them you checked? Please don't do cherry-picking. Don't assert too much more than what you actually did. Bobthefish2 ever gave a search result on Library of Congress, I re-checked it and am sure it is correct:

(note: Bobthefish2 has been topic banned for a year due to """"Decorum"""" issue, but it does not mean that the objective contents he used before cannot be used by us)
So, your point1 can be used by us to reach certain consensus. Your point2 is biased and it asserted too much more than reality and objectivity.

A tag has been placed on Nashaa Weiss requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

This makes the article NPOV.  I am sure that it may seem that Poles are dealt many criticisms about Anti-Semitism, but that is no different elsewhere in the world.  Of course, the unique relationship between Christian Poles and Polish Jews is duly noted as causing your perception.  Most people consider the Poles as superfriendly to Jews, but in fact the Polish commoners had no special like for Jews.  These common misperceptions would be best cleared up, if you kept all terms neutral as possible.  We don't need people getting upset and wanting to fight back and forth.  Your own feelings about being discriminated against by inconsiderate Jews going on their rants about the Holocaust, don't belong in the focus of an article.  You have every right to feel upset about the Blitzkrieg and Nazi occupation of your land, including your upset attitude in being slighted by the ignorance of foreigners who think that damage to your people was neglible or meaningless.  It is their ignorance and apathy that keeps them from forgetting about your loss, but Poles don't shove guilt upon the world about the Holocaust as many Jews seem to do.  Take it from me.  I used to have many misconceptions about the Poles and Wikipedia has changed them.

Regarding deleteing this article as being not notable.
Hi Regarding deleting this article as being not notable. the company was founded in 1824 and was an important ant horn comb manufacturer before the advent of plastics  it exported combs from England to America and the company was then very well known an ordinary thing like a comb used to be expensive as it was made of horn. 
The company Stockley and Wakelin does not trade any more so there is no commercial pourpose. There is another delete tag that that the article violates copyright as the material is elsewhere on the net. There is no copyright violation as the text elsewhere on the internet is my own. I am selling a Comb from made by Stokely and Wakelin  on e bay and decided to do a write-up on Stockely and wakely - The comb is being sold for six pounds - so my intention to write the article on the company could hardly be for the purpose of flogging the one ccomb. Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics.
Any way the article can be undeleted so that I and other wikipedians may improve on it and contribute to the knowledge of horn combs."

 Up to your old tricks I see 

Thankfully I have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you.

However I notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra - like the fucktard you are - it's """"unsourced"""". Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. 

Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. 

I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something. If Wikipedia is measured by the likes of you, then it's stands by the lowest common denominator: ignorance. Your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary it's laughable. Are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the Pope's a catholic? etc After seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter, I pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this site's even worse self-important cunts. Then when you suffer massive butthurt you'll quit and realise it was also fucking pointless being such a grandstanding bastard."""

 """"terrorism"""" again 

An editor has twice attempted to add a """"terrorist"""" designation to the first sentence of the lead, as a primary way of identifying the Weathermen.  I have now twice moved the material down to the section of the lead where the designation as domestic terrorists is discussed.  This is a charged issue, arising during a campaign in which the Weathermen are at issue as a way of discrediting one of the candidates.  Wikipedia has been a battleground on the issue of Weathermen being """"terrorists"""", across a number of articles.  Although it is notable that the FBI called them terrorists in 2004, three decades after the fact, and their views are worth inclusion (in my opinion), the FBI is not definitive in assessing history.  This is not the US state department list of terrorists or any official US designation - it is a history section on the FBI website.    """

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""". 
Just to refresh old memories Cuba was suppose to be for Cubans at the beginning of the revolution. For a while Now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to"

I still don't support renaming it though, as the """"provide a worldwide view"""" within this article is a mistake. As I mentioned above there are plenty of articles that can and should provide a worldwide view of Gun control issues, but the subject of this article is a US centric subject and should be re-factored in order to be presented as such. Rather then worrying about the name just get to work copy editing the article.
You seem to be arguing that there should be an article split, one article for the global and a split out article for the USA centric views.  Right?  If so, the problem still remains that the title of the global half of the split should have a global viewpoint.  And, the """"keep and"""" portion of the article title (taken from the US Bill of Rights) is decidedly USA centric.  Explain how """"keep and"""" is global.    
Or perhaps the article could take an approach as describing purely the concept of RKBA, and maybe the cultures and/nations where it exists, and other subjects as necessary (although I suspect the same debates will come up in those areas).  Perhaps altering the general approach and method of the article could be an alternative to renaming/moving it.  I'd be willing to give it a shot if everyone else would.  """

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,

Hi Werdna,someone correctly noted at WP:Requests for comment/May 2010 skin change/Bug reports#Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen that the preferences option """"Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen"""" doesn't actually do that. I notice that you changed the wording of that option one year ago, in rev:49553. Two questions:
 Was that requested or discussed anywhere, or more an ad-hoc wording and we can just tweak it to something like """"Widen the edit box to fill the available space""""?
 Why is that option in there in the first place? Seems to me that width:100% would be a good default for all installations, and site admins can just tweak it in their installations' CSS if they want.

Meetup

You may well have seen a site notice about the next Cambridge meetup, this Saturday 29 May. I thought those who have been in the past should have a personal invite, too.   

 What the hell? 

What the hell is """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" supposed to mean? I have virtually no involvement with RFA, and AFAIK am the single highest contributor of FAs to WP:LONDON; have you confused me with someone else?

As per my initial comments when the BM scheme was announced, I have serious reservations about creating formal ties between Wikipedia—whose prime selling point is editorial independence and a neutral point of view—and with any one museum, university or other institution. Quite aside from the glaring COI issue of an organisation paying people to promote their exhibits, nobody has even touched on the tax issues of paid editing being channelled (directly or indirectly) through the WMF. As you may know, I'm generally supportive of the idea of paid editing—I don't see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band, provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOV—but the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WP:Requests for comment/Paid editing. – scent 

 So you had serious and substantial reservations, and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons? It's like the Wikipedia version of Godwin's Law.
 I've already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in """"paid editing"""", on the discussion page itself.  Saying that the British Museum is """"paying people to promote their exhibits"""", is at odds with the facts of this situation (as Liam has explained). I have no comment on """"tax issues"""", and consider that outside of the community's remit in any case — it can be dealt with by the Foundation, if indeed money is being """"channeled through"""" the latter. Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me; if you'd like to make a big drama-fest out of somebody offering incentives to write featured-quality articles about notable historical artifacts, then I invite you to do so and see what response you get. —  • talk 

No, I had serious and substantial reservations, as did David Cane, and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced; to his extreme credit and unlike you, Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack. (Still waiting for that explanation of what """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" is supposed to mean.)

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15"""

 3RR warning 

Three times today (28 Oct.) you have reverted the """"sinusoids"""" language to your preferred """"trigonometric functions"""" language, as I've tried various things to explain, reference, talk about it, etc.  Please engage rather than just reverting.  If you revert again, I'll report you for 3RR violation again.  

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis). But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw).  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself. """"Sinusoids"""" is another result of your imagination as NO REFERENCE ON LSSA EVER MENTIONS IT, so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance, cleaning your shit is what it is.  """

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa.

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """

I've noticed that the various links have been removed now. I would agree that if a balance cannot be established, there should be no links to any external sites.

I wish I could find better sites to post, but those two are the only ones I've been able to locate. I did not mean to post a commercial site, and did not think I was posting a commercial site, since none of the sites I posted actually sold any poppers. In rereading your posts, heah, I noted that you thought the sites were commercials for poppers. I would agree that some might consider the second one as such, but the allaboutpoppers.com site is not. If you actually read it, which takes a while due to the huge amount of content, you'll find it's not commercial.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda.

Yes, some time ago the entire article on multi-level cosmology was deleted, but I think the deletion was premature and was the result of the unorthodox explanations of the theory. So even though the full article has been deleted, there is no reason, in the interest of science, not to mention the multi-level cosmology in other sections, and let others decide whether or not it is valid. Censorship, inquisition and suppression of science is counterproductive and harms science. If you are so obsessed with censorship of Wikipedia, do you also censor the articles in Tampa Tribune? Is your motivation religious? Kevin please stop your personal obsession with deletion and suppression of the multi level cosmology and do something more productive."""

This article reads more like a propaganda page than impartial information. It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horrod!) even further.

To say that NYMEX has """"no legal right to define measurement units"""" is a bogus argument.  What NYMEX has is the right to define or specify units that are pertinent to trade.  If NYMEX states that oil is to be traded in terms of barrels, then it is not """"illegal"""" for NYMEX to state the capacity of this thing called a """"barrel"""" in terms of unambiguous STANDARD units, or to point to an authoritative source (authoritative as far as NYMEX is concerned) that defines the capacity of a barrel.

 Main Page Layout 
Hello,

I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't find the information anywhere. Can someone direct me to an article on how to remove the title from the article? For example, on my wiki the main page always says """"Main Page"""" on top and I would like to remove it. Thanks in advance.

Also, if you can also point me to where i can change the """"article"""" tab on top to """"main page"""" that would be great too. Thanks again.

I don't know much about this, but perhaps it's the skin you are using. Go to My Preferenses, then Skin and select MonoBook. 
Unfortunately, you can only do this if you log in or create an account.  (Talk) 
This is a technical question about the MediaWiki software best asked on Wikipedia:Village pump (technical). It's not difficult to do this but it would require code changes.  

I believe this is done in MediaWiki:Monobook.js, with the following lines of code:
var mpTitle = """"Main Page"""";
var isMainPage = (document.title.substr(0, document.title.lastIndexOf("""" - """")) == mpTitle);
var isDiff = (document.location.search && (document.location.search.indexOf(""""diff="""") != -1 || document.location.search.indexOf(""""oldid="""") != -1));
 
if (isMainPage && !isDiff) 
{
document.write('/**/ #lastmod, #siteSub, #contentSub, h1.firstHeading { display: none !important; } /**/');
Correct me if wrong, but I think all you have to do is add these lines to Monobook.js  
This would be good to add to the Main Page FAQ.  (talk contribs ) 

Thanks for all your help. With your input, I was able to google search for the very answer to my solution here. Basically, its like you guys said edit the username:Monobook.js page (or Mediawiki:Monobook.js if you want to change it for the entire site - just search for that page), and append the extra code. My apologies if this posting is located in the wrong area, I simply could not find any other spot to leave this message. Thanks again.  21:15, 7 September 2006

Suggestion
I think that adding a link to the sandbox (in a prominent place, not in the small print) will help new users to find a right place to experiment, and not carry out trial edits on actual pages. My hypothesis is that this will noticeably reduce unconstructive edits falling under the new user test category. Any support for my theory?  
 Firstly I think it's a good thing that random tests can occur in main space. It rams home the fact that wikipedia can be edited by anyone. The only way for some people to believe this is to try it. Secondly, even after the header redesign for this page with the """"red flashing lights"""" many people still don't notice it. But even after my disparigment I'm not against including a link to the sandbox somewhere more prominent, where do you suggest?  
I suggest with the Overview · Searching · Editing · Questions · Help part, the one under the 'Welcome to Wikipedia' box. With a brief explanation of what it's for in brackets, so new users know what it's for and don't get perplexed by what they see as yet another confusing feature of Wikipedia.  
At the moment, at 800x600 pixel resolution, there is no room for any more links in that area.  
OK...how about including it in either the navigation or the toolbox boxes on the left side of the window instead of on the Main Page? That way, the sandbox is accessible anywhere without having to know what to type into the search field or having to go back to the Main Page, which might achieve my aim better since it's less troublesome to go to the sandbox.

But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting """"immigrants"""". They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of """"God"""" and """"son"""" means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be """"friends""""??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like """"The Beatles""""! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: """"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you."""" This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to """"area of rest""""- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize """"Don't sweat the small stuff"""". Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

You cannot argue that the 2 wikis are discussing the same event, so to then argue that because of the common name for said event is in your mind, and understandably so, non-neutral that we should then censor that undermines core principles of the wikis. Yes the wiki should server to convey facts and hopefully transfer knowledge, but what we think are facts are almost always perceptions of facts.

It seems the owner of Wikipedia, Jimbo Wales, has developed a close personal relationship with 19 year old Justin Berry, the former underage camwhore and adult porn webmaster recently profiled in a series of New York Times articles by writer Kurt Eichenwald.  At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, """"pedophile trolling,"""" which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a """"personal attack,"""" and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.

Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are """"copyright violations"""", even though Wikipedia is filled with """"fair use"""" pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.   

Way to go Jimbo, you're a rancid agenda-pushing piece of shit, and I greatly regret having contributed to your encyclopedic turd-pile.  Perhaps you should rename this endeavor """"The Oprah Encyclopedia.""""  Fuck you.  """

I too have never heard the term """"chip romney"""". I'll remove it as soon as I finish writing this- it's unofficial, and isn't a nickname of sorts.
According the the Romney Marsh page, it does extend into Sussex, so by all means we should re-write the location to include this.
I think what you are referring to in your third point was a bit of a mistranslation. Where I don't really know anything about the place of Romney Marsh, I think the editor who wrote that part meant that one of the reasons Romney's were such a success in this area was because of their hardiness. Perhaps this could be re-written too- but as I said, I don't know too much about the place, so I'll leave that to other editors.
For point four, we really need to find external sources to back this up.
For the black points, we should write a section that incorporates a world-wide view. This article is generally focused on one or two areas of the world, so we should really include the general standards for each country. In Australia, for instance, at the shows I've gone to pink on the nose is generally looked down on, but if it's a 'good' sheep, this is minor, and is overlooked quite a bit. Discoloured hooves, however, tend to have more weight on a judge's decision. It's really a matter of who's judging. I'm not sure about other countries, but I do know in the US pink has a lot more weight on a judge's decision than most other countries.
Agreeing with you on your 6th point. Crimp also needs to be defined.
Point 7- you seem to know more on the uses of Romney wool. Keep in mind that we'll need to find reliable external sources for this information.
Point 8- Romney interest in Australia has dropped off considerably, but as you say in NZ is still very high. Again, see what I said before- the article needs to incorporate a worldwide view.
Altogether, the article needs expansion, more reliable sources and a worldwide view. With enough work, we could even get this up to GA standard. ''''''  talk |

About the Black–White difference in IQ, which at the time was about 15 points, the Neisser et al.

That conclusion stands today: There has been no new direct evidence on the question. (See Rushton & Jensen, 2005a, 2005b, Gottfredson, 2005, and Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002, for the view that the Black–White IQ difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. See Nisbett, 2005, 2009, for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.

re German Pigeon Club Links
G'day Mate, I guess what I'm trying to say by wanting them footnoted is that """"External links should not normally be used in the body of an article"""" as per that style guideline. Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text. In my opinion that would look a whole lot better and fits the Wikipedia guidelines better.  Buzz Me... """

Well I aint gonna go a fair process anyways just like what they did here apparently  is a big power tripper bullying smaller contributors here for his own agenda by calling me a puppet of someone I do not know despite the block being only a possilikely and was never confirmed that I was. Apparently the user does not seem to know the word consensus either as seen in the recent talk page dicussion wherein there were no true final agreement between him and other users such as HTD and carries out things already at his will. See how he bullied his way into kicking me and other users out of a civilized talk about MRT-2?  I just hope that he would not victimize more users here as maybe he might be really this Jerome guy wherein Jerome is his fall guy for opposing users. I do hope I could open a SPI investigation with him, HTD, and this Jerome guy as maybe they are the true socks. Just when I thought the Government is the dirtiest place there could be, Riohondo the user proved me there is so much more. Anyways delete my images on commons if you want to just never rename them to """"LRT-2"""" or change something to that incorrect name.

Hi Paul,
At first glance your theory page seems to be really rich. However, after reading the lead part, I have to agree with you that the language is sort of unclear. More importantly, my feel is that it reads like fragments mixed together but not well integrated. Therefore, I suggest that you may want to work on better summarize the theory and make it more like an article than excerpt. 
Another suggestion from me regards the structure. Obviously, the sections after “Criticism of the theory” were not organized logically. (For example criticism of the theory itself shows up twice.) I think you have done a great job in your page edit outline in describing how you are going to restructure it. 
Also, I just want to mention that you “bonus analysis of talk page” is really fascinating!!! I might do a similar analysis as well, because it addresses some general concerns from a community that not only read the article but also try to enhance it."

 Straw poll on Srebrenica massacre 

As a result of persistent edit warring on Srebrenica massacre, I have proposed that a straw poll be taken regarding one of the issues involved—namely, how to title the section currently named """"Alternative views"""".  This will help us to determine whether there is a consensus on what to title this section, or at least a consensus on what not to call it.  The straw poll can be found at Talk:Srebrenica_massacre#Straw poll on """"Alternative views"""" section.  I have posted this announcement to each of the 19 users who have made multiple edits to Srebrenica massacre this year.  — """
KtcB14ujYBtru6D,""", 24 November 2011 (UTC)

My apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above. I have re-read it and can still find none. You """"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study"""", while I believe that """"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead"""". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.
As to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.
On the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.
More directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a """"star polygon"""", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a """"simple polygon"""". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as """"simple"""" or """"convex"""" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person's preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.
With that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34"""

 reference over the last 1000 edits on the article or more. I assume you'd intense the gravity of his actions here, he is simply soo bent on for just the removal of this particular line. Basically Etymology deals with various perspectives of a word and their history. It is absurd to quote that Maldives could have only been derived from Sanskrit. The literal English translation for Maladvipa is """"Garland of Flowers"""", and the Tamil(Malaithivu) and Malayalam(Maladwipu) terms used here too mean """"Garland of Flowers"""". This is the statement contained in the article, before User:SriSuren interfered with his POV discretely removing this content but retaining only the Sinhala translation. 

User:SriSuren keeps talking on trash about the old source and persistently attacking me with nonsensical accusations about my editing but is totally evasive on how this particular text(and with the source, which provides the accurate Tamil translation)

is supposedly 'WP:OR' or 'problematic'. Instead he simply rambles on accusing me of 'disruptive' editing, 3 vs 1 etc without explaining what exactly is in the text that needs to be modified. I have gone through his behavior in this talk page as well elsewhere, and I can see he has grossly abused these discussions, absolutely necessitating the need for Administrative action on his behavior, for disgracefully violating the TPGs. Almost all his edits(which have been consistently poised against the Tamil people in general need to be reviewed, and he needs to explain on what overall value he has added to wikipedia in his edits, except for adding/removing sensitive information that fulfills his whims) So perhaps, involvement of more editors to the issue will see through his low-down motives with which he edits, and the barbaric means he resorts to when he gets desperate. So I guess we let him do his course of job, as there is sadly not much room to deal with his uncivil and inflammatory behavior.  (talk . contr . mail) """

The authors discuss the lack of reliable data on the number of ASL users and the widely disparate estimations made on the web (100,000 to 15,000,000). They conclude that no reliable estimate of the number of signers exists, and that most estimates can be traced to two unreliable studies in the 1970s. This wikipedia article, when it was accessed by the author (November 9, 2004), suggested that ASL ranked somewhere between 3rd-most and 10th-most used language in the USA.

ioTtAzmMUxEvsTn,First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency.

I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either.

I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world. Idiots like you will also complain how your own press are not independent.

Article issues
This article has some issues that need to be addressed. The first is that of notability. As it is now, the article fails to establish any notability. It is merely a plot summary and, as was explained numerous times at Talk:List of NCIS episodes, Wikipedia is not for plot summaries. It is likely that each individual episode of a television series will not be notable on its own. As per WP:PLOT, """"a concise plot summary is appropriate as part of the larger coverage of a fictional work"""", but on its own the plot does not establish notability. As it says in the {{notability}} tag that kepps getting removed, notability needs to be established by adding reliable, secondary sources. At the moment, there are none. More on this later.

The plot summary in this article is not concise by any means. It needs to be pruned and appropriate information concerning """"the reception, impact, and significance"""" of the episode must be added.

A third issue is that of references. I've already mentioned that reliable, secondary sources do not exist in the article. Of the two references that do exist in the article, one is a primary source. The other (cbsncis.wetpaint.com) is a fan wiki that anyone can edit and so it is not a reliable source. Open wikis such as cbsncis.wetpaint.com are questionable, self-published sources and are generally not acceptable. The expansion of this article will require much better sources.   """

I hope it's clarified. The ideas were connected in my head, but I did not mean to imply that you want PHG banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility. I agree that PHG needs to better accept criticism and learn a thing or two about reliable sourcing (hence my emphasis on OWN and RELIABLE), but I have yet to see the evidence (which isn't to say it doesn't exist) that he """"pour[s] bad information and fringe theories into Wikipedia"""". Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a """"reprimand"""" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one. Frankly, I like your sourcing amendment, I'd even consider lessening the length of the ban if PHG were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project, since I think sourcing is the major issue here.

  Army Medical Services Museum branding equipment Dear Gaius, 

My name is Simon Barnard. I'm an author and illustrator residing in Melbourne, Australia. Currently I'm producing a book on British convicts transported to Australia with Text Publishing. 

Amongst the convicts sentenced to Australia are over 1,000 army deserters, many of whom were branded with a 'd'. Your photo of the branding equipment and human skin located in the Army Medical Museum is of great interest to me. 

I've contacted the Museum in an attempt obtain more information and, in particularly, a photo of the skin, but they're unable to assist.

I'm rather desperate to obtain a decent photo of the skin and am hoping you might be able to help me in this bizarre quest.

Also, this is the current religion section that I'd like to check with other users to reach consensus. What do you guys think?:

A 2012 national telephone survey in English of a sample of 400 Iranian-Americans, commissioned by the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans and conducted by Zogby Research Services, asked the respondents what their religions were.  The responses broke down as follows: Muslim: 31%, """"No response"""": 15%,  atheist/realist/humanist: 11%, agnostic: 8%, Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and """"Other"""": 15%. The survey had a cooperation rate of 31.2%. The margin of error for the results was +/- 5 percentage points, with higher margins of error in sub-groups.

Due to the laws regarding apostasy in Islam, some Iranians do not claim Islam as their religion, but would in fear of persecution. The Central Committee for Ex-Muslims was founded by Iranian Ehsan Jami with an aim to support apostates and to bring forth the reality of women's rights violations in the religion. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through war and invasion, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the novel, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious.

There are religious and ethnolinguistic differences among the Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Christian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Assyrian groups.Nilou Mostofi, Who We Are: The Perplexity of Iranian-American Identity, The Sociological Quarterly (published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the Midwest Sociological Society), Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 681–703, p. 685 Calculating the percentage of Christian Iranian-Americans is difficult because most Iranian Christians are of Armenian or Assyrian origin and self-identify as such, rather than as Iranian."""

I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.

 One Addition 

Mustafaa, I promised much more stuff but have been too busy lately.
One thing that sticks out and could be fixed quickly is the beginning of the invasion.
Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:
 """"On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""""
should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:
 Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)
 There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...
 The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. 
 Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.

I'll post links and add more explanations if needed.

'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

Apparantly, Aaron this article is the way you'' want it to be, just to get some accuracy into your last comment.

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

yVwoTNsdZtPz2jM,"Dear Readers, I have been forced to make some editorial changes due to the attack on my reputation. It is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name. A few points. Moving from Toronto to B.C was for one sole reason and that was to find work. There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.
It has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays. I in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such! Finally this question about pictures. The Manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all. I do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on Mannings part. Please prove otherwise.
Once last thing re the Mulroney dinner. I was not dressed as chef, that was John Clarke not me. I simply walked into the room and towards the podium. I did not nor was I ever in the kitchen at any time. I suggest you check the archives of the Toronto Star and Toronto SUN.
In addition I am seeking a legal judgement against the pro-choice action network for their slanderous article and I would ask politely that you not link to it.
I am making every effort here to be accomodating and would ask the same please of Wiklepdia.

Thank you.

THEY BOTH REALLY SUCK! Watch something worthwhile like Family Guy or King of the Hill.
That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype. Both FG and KOTH can be funny but there comes a point when you want a break from all those cynical shows that are all about laughing at someone's ignorance and stupidity.  
Hey wait a second. Totally Spies sucks. Kim Possible was good, but later jumped the shark. it then became the worst show ever (well, not as bad as totally spies or futurama, but got close). Also, as for another comment above, Teenage Robot  was AWFUL. Robot Jones was way better. And as for the final one, King of the Hill was great, but Family Guy is unfunny. It is better than Futurama though, FUTURAMA WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING EVER MADE!!!!

Don't watch the new KP, watch something good like King of the Hill or Shinigan Down."

Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

However, Great Britain is afforded a great deal of respect from the German Reich as its Empire and historical institutions were greatly admired by Adolf Hitler and German society in general even in the years before World War II.""""

 """"Right to be forgotten"""" 

I think that the present conflict between Google and the Spanish Data Protection Agency bears watching.  The Spanish are seeking input from the EU, and could in the worst case become a model for EU countries.  Many of the 90 people who the Spanish want censored from the Google results would not be affected the same way by Wikipedia - hopefully people would add information about a lawsuit's dismissal, and a principal known only for public urination wouldn't be notable.  But Wikipedians might believe that someone who murders but gets off on temporary insanity is notable, and shouldn't be allowed to move on with his life until the victim moves on with his.

Wikipedia might be a natural ally for Google, since balanced articles here, appearing high in the rankings, can offset the impact of raw hits on news headlines.  And Google's deletions, if forced, would hinder our research.  In the end, the way to deal with petty prejudice by human resources functionaries is to fight for equal and widespread access to employment, rather than to impose censorship.  The latter approach only helps those who have actually done things wrong, not those who simply have an appearance that bigots don't like.   """

I got rid of this first paragraph for several reasons:
Capitalism is typically and generally defined as an economic system where the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit; investment, pricing, and distribution decisions are privately made rather than instituted by state control, and a free market exists for goods and services.
First, """"typically"""" and """"generally"""" are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.  Any definition with this many problems has to go.    |  Talk  17:42, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)"""

RL6XjJmcxRon5iE,"Hopeless. How can Ryulong have the nerve to meddle in linguistic topics without knowing linguistics at all? Considering his anti-intellectual attitude, combined with 100-pages-per-day edits, I cannot imagine how tremendous damage he has done to Wikipedia.
First of all, he must learn the difference between phonology and phonetics. That's a minimum requirement to join the discussion. Everyone in the field knows the distinction.
Showing that Ryulong's accusation against me is groundless is as easy as pie. Just check John R. Bentley's A Linguistic History of the Forgotten Islands (2008) for example. You can find the spellings I used above.
The real problem is that the book is a serious linguistic work. If Ryulong reads it without even knowing the distinction between phonology and phonetics, he will taint Wikipedia with another bunch of errors."

Early Years
History
The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston has pursue his solo career for a try and he almost release his album but it was not succesful, and he formed a group named Foretance in February 6 2008 along with a new band named Boys Do Cry, the band consists the same members, and the band has abandoned the name of the band and performed at 4 Aces Studio without no name.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name."

At any rate, my colleague Pete Spotts is a top-notch science writer (and a good guy). Below is his little biography from our website. Think on it:   

""""Pete Spotts joined the Monitor in September 1976 after a two-year stint at the Miami Herald. Prior to mixing pens with test tubes as a science reporter, Spotts served as Midwest correspondent, staff editor in National News, special-projects editor, National News editor, and chief editorial writer. In 1987, Spotts shared an award with three Monitor colleagues for a series on the future of nuclear energy following the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl. In 2003, he received an American Association for the Advancement of Science's Science Journalism Award. He was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the 1999-2000 academic year and also received a two-week fellowship at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Spotts is a graduate of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla. In his spare time, Spotts enjoys hiking, camping, photography, ham radio, and amateur astronomy."""""""

 Jonathan Sposato Article for Creation 

Hi Kevin!

I saw that you recently declined my article for Jonathan Sposato, due to """"non-notability"""". Per your suggestion, I reviewed the Wikipedia Notability terms and requirements, and believe my article has met these and that Mr. Sposato is someone of notability. Jonathan is the chairman of the largest media company in Seattle - Geekwire - and the site's readership is now larger than The Seattle Times, and is one of the country's top 20 technology websites today . I was assuming this would qualify him as being someone notable, so please let me know if I am missing a piece of information or rules as to his qualification? I am working on this article with an editor currently writing a biography about Mr. Sposato, who was also unable to identify an area in which we fall short.

For example, which town were you born in, what did your parents do, which schools did you go to, when did you first start playing around with magic, where was your first performance, do you have any family members who are in the magician trade?  I've got more questions too, but we can start with those.  ;)   """

History of Primal Therapy article

I read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.

My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:

If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".

Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.

On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.

Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )

Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  

You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:
""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""
Further down the same page he added:
""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""

p9gV7xHlMXqiRct,"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""". He also aggressively removed a legitimate talking point from the article's talk page as """"unsourced bollocks"""". My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article. It was cited (by me) and must have passed some scrutiny to remain in the article. Right?

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities. The truth is, Rodhullandemu began all this anomosity between him and I and it all goes back to this. I'm sure this constitutes a personal attack, especially as I've since been vindicated regarding our feud (ie; I was 100% correct; he was not). So at least issue him with a warning regarding his aggressive conduct. That would be the civil thing to do.   """

There is still a lot that cannot be checked, like copyvios from offline books and selective bias, but I suppose we should check what we can. But something else has changed, and I don't know what it is. There seems to be almost a mood of hostility to new submissions. DYK does not seem to be a welcoming place for newbies.

 The Pit and the Pendulum is a 1961 horror film directed by Roger Corman, starring  Vincent Price, Barbara Steele, John Kerr, and Luana Anders.  The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in 16th century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by  American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's  House of Usher released the previous year. A critical and box office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers. Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film. (more...) """

Hi Daniel. The block is extremely odd. IMO, there is no real discussion of my activity in that AN thread in connection with a siteban.

Blueboy, a new admin that improperly blocked me, an established editor, as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom I blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me.

I can't believe how you people run this place. WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month. NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page. At a bare minimum, restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some.

New policy proposal and draft help

Wikipedia:Scientific standards

I have drafted a new proposal and would like help in clarifying, adjusting, adapting, and improving it. It is based on five years of work here at Wikipedia (not always the prettiest, I might add). I think it summarizes the opinions of a great majority of editors as to how to handle scientific situations. This proposal serves as a nexus between WP:NPOV and WP:RS for cases where we are dealing with observable reality. It is needed because there are a lot of editors who don't seem to understand what entails best-practices when writing a reliable reference work about observable reality. I don't pretend that this version is perfect, and would appreciate any and all additions, suggestions people may have for getting to some well-regarded scientific standards.

Note that these standards would apply only when discussing matters directly related to observable reality. These standards are inspired in part by WP:SPOV but avoid some of the major pitfalls of that particular proposal. In particular, the idea that SPOV even exists is a real problem. However, I think it is undeniable that we should have some standards for writing about scientific topics.

See also WP:SCI for another failed proposal that dovetails with this one. I hope this particular proposal is more in-line with the hole I see in policy/guidelines for dealing with these situations.

  

I have added a section that I think necessary for balance. I doubt you will like it, but I think it necessary to express the rue meaning of POV. I have not yet attempted to harmonize it with the discordant elements in some of the previous sections, some of which I consider rather clearly remarkable violations of NPOV, pojectivity, and the way i think a properly skeptical scientist looks at the world.   '  

Actually, I find nothing wrong with the content of what you are writing and essentially I think the same thing. One bit I do find strange is this """"primary approach"""" issue. My idea is the following:

A religious/philosophical/spiritual/metaphysical/etc. article should discuss all ideas about a subject relevant to the main approach to the article. Virgin Mary is the Christian ideas about the Virgin Mary; Reincarnation is about the various reincarnation-believing groups' approach to reincarnation and so on. 
Most ideas are utterly irrelevant to science because they will deal with things other than observable reality
If and when such an article happens in the natural course of development to discuss a particular idea that is contradicted by or is supported by scientific evidence, the idea is first presented from the perspective of the main approach to the article. 
Issues which have scientific evidence should have the scientific evidence that is directly relevant to the issue and nothing more. The evidence should be presented simply and straightforwardly without attempts to exaggerate, inflate, marginalize, or eliminate it.
Article continues on, unaffected by the scientific evidence presented.

That's what I envision. I think it is very close to what you envision too.

Now, I do have some issues with your particular choice in"

An illegal alien who entered the United States without inspection, for example, would be strictly defined as an immigrant under the INA but is not a permanent resident alien. Lawful permanent residents are legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States. They may be issued immigrant visas by the Department of State overseas or adjusted to permanent resident status by the Department of Homeland Security in the United States.Permanent Resident Alien Definition

Hello, Director.sara, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

Just logged into find loads of stuff about you.  It looks like it's getting harder for you having to do lots of edits, before your main edits.  Is it worth the effort x

Hello there, me old fruit!

It is true that it's getting harder for me with having to put in ten edits before I can use my accounts. They sometimes get spotted and blocked whilst I'm making the ten edits, especially if I've just used an account and especially if User:Hut 8.5's online. I have generally targeted a dormant user talk page or tagged my own sockpuppets to achieve the ten edits.

It is not too difficult yet. User:Raul654 has put in loads of IP rangeblocks which do restrict me. I can generally get on using BT.

There seems to be a concerted effort now by many different users to revert my edits quickly. I suppose a good measure of my effectiveness is the percentage of the time that my edits are visible, or whether the page is fully protected. That percentage is very low at the moment. VICS is fully protected, but Northwich Victoria F.C. and Witton Albion F.C. are not.

It is worth the effort; I still hate the whole Wikipedia concept of truth by consensus. I can cope with being reverted within minutes by many different editors, being checkusered regularly and blocked on sight. User:Raul654's checkuser investigations are only about 95 - 98% accurate in terms of percentage of accounts that he labels actually being me.

I have included your message to me because  routine.

Moxy, I get rudely rapped over the knuckles when I refactor. But you get away with it. Never mind, because in any event there seems to be a WP rule for everything, and a WP rule against everything. The real intellectual challenge seems to be to find a balance between the two, which nobody inluding myself seems able to do.
Re unsigned editor above: Thanks. You have been the very first editor to provide helpful criticism and guidance, which I believe is supposed to be the function of administrator. Usually my work is simply undone and reverted by admin and others without discussion; a kind of slap in the face. Talk about civility. Hmmm. Nice people. 
 Suggestion: instead of administrators and others engaging in endless displacement activity, why isn't anyone prepared to address the real issue around here, namely the primary issue I raised (again) at Reply to uninvolved intervening party which bears repeating: 
 WP:FRINGE, (and probably other wiki rules as well), states that: """"In general, Wikipedia should always give prominence to established lines of research found in reliable sources and present neutral descriptions of other claims with respect to their historical prominence (and) ideas should not be excluded from the encyclopedia simply because they are widely held to be wrong."""" Please note that the rule does NOT state: Wikipedia should always give prominence to established WESTERN lines of research found in reliable WESTERN sources."""" Yet this is exactly what the existing WW2 article does do. Not even one non-Western source is cited among the 340 odd sources cited .... 
 On my bookshelf right here beside me are no less that seven English language non-Western histories of WW2, some of them by Soviet historians. So there's no question about the existence of English language non-Western histories. These are considered reliable and established lines of research in their respective non-Western countries of origin, just as the Western sources cited in the article are considered to be reliable and from established lines of research in the West. Therefore both Western and non-Western positions should be reflected in the article, if it is to claim that it's NPOV, which it is not. Forget about all the efforts to discredit me, some of which are perfectly valid. Just address the issue at hand, namely POV bias through omission as repeatedly alleged by me, and which has resulted in a lot of displacement activity that seeks to evade the central issue of NPOV. Even or especially the intervening administrator has managed to evade the issue. The unsigned editor in this section admits that he has reliable access to history library resources so, if he has the time and inclination, maybe HE can come up with some reliable non-Western sources in the interests of NPOV, which everyone claims I'm contravening (among other things).

What was done on these two pages is a bit different from the pages I'm used to seeing.  Most of the pages I've looked at place a  tag in a section named References, and populate that section with inline REF_ITEM instances, where REF_ITEM is often formatted by one of the citation templates from WP:CITET.  Individual REF_ITEMs in the text hook to their References section appearances via numbered links and backlinks supplied by the mechanism behind the , , and  tags (the Cite.php extension to MediaWiki) .  The {{ref}} & {{note}} template family can also be used to supply connective links and backlinks, but don't do auto-numbering of links.

WP:GTL describes the References section as containing """"... [items] that you used in constructing the article and have referenced (cited) in the article. An example is then given using , which puts the example item into a  collection under an example section named (confusingly, to me) Notes instead of References.

What appears to have been done on the two pages being discussed here is that the items which would go in the References section have been broken up into (1) some harvard-referenced books and (2) other stuff  mostly web pages but some books as well on the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry page , with the harvard-referenced books being put in a bulleted list in a section titled References and the other stuff in a list auto-numbered with  etc. in a section named Notes.

You are right.  Gelato is simply Italian for ice-cream.  When I see it, I say """"gelato"""" in Italian and """"ice-cream"""" in English.  However, Americans think they are clever when they use foreign words, and they have decided that """"gelato"""" (or """"gelado"""" as they pronounce it) is some special thing similar to ice-cream but with less cream.  For the rest of us it's just """"a creamy brand of ice-cream"""" (una marca di gelato abbastanza cremoso) or """"a not so creamy brand of ice-cream"""" (una marca di gelato poco cremoso).

Here in Australia, it's even worse.  They say """"geladi"""", presumably because Italian ice-cream parlours have """"GELATI"""" (""""ICE-CREAMS"""") written out front, so they have decided that it is a special word for the product inside.

You'll see the same tendency in the word """"prosciutto"""".  People will actually say """"it's not ham; it's pro-shoo-do"""", which is bemusing to Italian-speakers.  What they mean by """"pro-shoo-do"""" is sometimes """"Italian ham"""", sometimes """"dry-cured ham"""".  It's beyond me why they can't just call a spade a spade.

A final note: my girlfriend once went to Italy and ordered a """"lattay"""", as she pretentiously would in Australia.  She got her comeuppance however, when they gave her the glass of milk (latte) that she ordered, rather than the milky coffee (caffellatte) that she wanted!  —  """

What you should do is not to listen to the pro-redirect editor and let many editors improve the article so that it is not a copy of the murder article.  Then it can be judged on its own.  If people add biographical details to the murder article, those will probably be removed because they are unrelated to the murder.  So we are stunning the growth due to inflexible rules.

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

We need to do some work here people, and pull together some references:  there are plenty in Nick Griffins case!   """

Let me just give you fair warning though, that the editor who initiated the move request has a long involvement in this, and all those folks that are supporting this move along side you are the native German speakers who were adamant against any form of compromise.  A bit weird they all show up within a couple days, isn't it?  LOL  The editor who made this move request regularly communicates offsite through e-mail, hence my suspicions.  Anyway, you'd think people could compromise, wouldn't you?  I guess history tells us that some humans are not capable of compromise...  So, anyway, as far as your research, and I'm not sure where you are based, but if you are in the United States, try dropping by a Whole Foods, etc.. and you'll see that products from this region are labeled as coming from Alto Adige.   This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.

The Haaretz's source (Mizrahi) isn't exactly an authority source on Abdul Rahman's life, family sources in Yemen are more credible, but the best source is an autobiography or written biography by someone who knew him.

Consider also for a moment the ubiquitous discrepancy between police and protestor attendance estimates at political rallies.
IMHO attendance figures should be removed unless they are verified by a reasonably independent source. Alternatively, it should be highlighted that these are figures directly from the Catholic Church.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted.

Something anonymous editing has given rise to

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

There are several points in the current article that are designed to distort who I am or my work.  The lede says I'm an """"embed on assignment in Iraq"""".  I've spent just as much time in Iraq.   I'm not nor have I ever been a blogger.  I've never """"blogged"""" and yet the article claims blogging and commentary citing my participation in Fox Forums.  The truth is that I've written far more hard news for Foxnews.com and have only participated in Fox Forum when requested to by the editor.  The current focus of the article on blogging is meant to minimize my credentials as a reporter.  I'm also likened to Rich Merritt and Jeff Gannon.  Two comparisons that are meant to smear me and are also awkwardly placed in the article

You said that I should not be drawn into petty disputes but these issues have been in the article for two years and despite many protests no one has even bothered to answer why or how these comments have been put into the article.  Could you ask for some explanation or move to have the wording replaced?  Also, there was an image of Ann Coulter and myself in the article and it was removed.  The image is, however, a part of the general controversy.  Any word on why it was removed?

However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself.

All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

I won't comment further on the book, as I think my comments below are sufficient.
Regarding the Web sites, I would note that there seems to be very few Web sites on Plasma Cosmology / Plasma Universe (unlike sites on Big Bang cosmology), and I think that is worth taking into account.
plasmacosmology.net
... appears to be generally OK to me. I see obvious areas of contention, with section on the Electric Universe, Ancient Testimony, and Speculations. But these pages are separate and obvious, and do not seem to """"pass off"""" the more speculative material as if it were pure Plasma Cosmology.
... the site certainly isn't peer reviewed, and it is unlikely to have been produced by an """"authority""""... the Contact page says """"Independent Researcher""""
... The site more closely resembles a """"blog"""" since it appears to be produced by one person, but that is not grounds for automatic dismissal. We already include a page from the Web site of Ned Wright,, and while he is obviously an authority on Big Bang cosmology, I would argue that he is not an authority on Plasma Cosmology. Nevertheless, I am sure he points out some errors in Eric Lerner's work, and I am sure that Lerner has pointed out misunderstandings in Wright's. Either way, there seems to be value in Wright and Lerner's pages (irrespective of whether we agree with their points of view). Likewsise, I think there is value in plasmacosmology.net, even though there may be disagreements with parts of it.
thunderbolts.info
I must declare a potential conflict of interest with the site, as I am shown as a contributor,, so I will refrain from commenting more, unless you specifically ask me to do so, now knowing the connection.

Then a cadre of fascist, self-important, imperious, asinine pricks took it upon themselves to systematically target my contributions, which were well withing guidelines and certainly along the lines of the 1000's of cultural references in Simpson's articles. They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will. Now I'm motivated to be as asinine and ignorant as they are. I'm wholesale deleting anything without a source or reference. I'm disallowing references I personally feel are insufficient. Every article locked I feel is a victory, because it diminishes Wikipedia to lock articles, and its due to their actions that they are locked, so I feel vindicated.

 Tip 

When the bot tells you that a vandal is a school IP, that should usually set alarm bells ringing. Considering it's probably some teenager on his lunch break, warning them probably isn't very productive . Personally, I think all school IPs should be blocked a son as they're identified as such since they're ususally pretty static and they bring nothing but vandalism, but then I also think logging in should be compulsory, so perhaps I'm just a pessimist! ;)  | Penny for your thoughts?

 Weedpatch Camp 

Thanks for creating the article.  I actually went on a photo-spree through parts of central CA several months ago, and when handling my childhood home around Kern, I took a photo of what turned out to be an inaccurately addressed Weedpatch Camp (I had taken a photo of the Sunset School, which was important in relation to the history of the area but not the NRHP site).  I had a feeling something was fishy about the location, and some extensive internet research finally revealed what (and where!) the real buildings were.

All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared. 

The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.

If EIGHT BLACK TEENS were CAUGHT robbing people in that neighborhood, not to mention the ones that didn't get caught, then you'd have to be an IDIOT to not eyeball someone acting as suspiciously as Trayvon. For all we know, he could have robbed someone in the sub in one of his visits. We know the cops said he had a jewel-thieving tool. 

Oh that's right, the cops are not to be trusted. Except when they tell you 'We don't need you to do that.' Then you MUST obey! lol

Found it (capacity to conduct foreign relations). But it's not the """"problem"""" criteria for SoP - for SoP the problem criteria is the control of populated territory (e.g. ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there). For example on p10/11 of the source: """"has a government...have a legislative body...have a judicary...have an executive, which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will."""" - in the case of SoP the territory it claims (regardless of undefined borders) is under Israel occupation/control. All other criteria are more or less satisfied - PLO-EC is SoP provisional government in exile, SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states, SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states, SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application. The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA - whether SoP is """"peace loving"""", whether SoP is """"able and willing"""" to carry out the membership obligations. Even if it's deemed """"peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations"""" the """"problem"""" criteria is whether it's """"really a state"""" (because it doesn't have control over populated territory) and the related whether it's """"able to carry out the obligations"""" (because a state needs control over populated territory, otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a government-in-exile and doesn't have the ability to do anything on the ground). Of course, if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 2/3rds of the UN members want - for political reasons - they can grant membership to a GiE (turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that it's able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it, but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts, so they won't take it into account, etc.)

 Talk: WikiProject Comics 

In the interest of everyone who watches the page for ongoing discussions, please stop making irrelevant, minor changes to the page simply so that you can ramble in an edit summary. People watch that page in the interest of relevant discussion. Also, it appears that for a few days you added two paragraphs to the page that didn't add to the discussion, only to revert them. Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics is on the watchlist of numerous editors, so if you could stop crowding it with nonsense that would be nice. Cheers.   
It wasn't nonsense. A topic was brought up regarding the contents of a certain story arc, and since it extensively quoted my story, character archetypes, scenes, etcetera, I very honestly filled in what the thematics were, as I am chronically upfront and very impulsive, but also tend to rethink and fix things I do that might have been a bad idea.  
Some of the involved people (or at least Kurt Parker used some of their catchphreases regarding me, whereas I remember Joe Quesada mentioning that he considers """"Spidey"""" his favourite fan several years ago), censored it.  I do have a problem with that the ones responsible didn't just talk with me directly from the start and explain the situation clearly, rather than attacking, and then didn't even have the decency to actually stand for the very statistically unlikely yet real ridiculously extreme hate-tirade against me. I mean, I as good as always stand for anything I do, and it is all comparatively extremely trivial.  
Yet I've apparently got lots of western comics crossover, movies, tv series, computer games, books, and manga inexplicably focusing extensively on me in some kind of vendetta for a long time, which is extremely confusing for somebody literalminded with limited sensory filters like myself.  One obscure story to process and put horrible input I had been exposed to behind me (well, 30000 visits counts as obscure in my book), and almost completely random Wikipedia nad tvtropes edits somehow equalled a global media campaign reaching hundreds of millions, while declaring me a genocidal lunatic...  My """"does not compute blinkers"""" have gone haywire for quite a while now to say the least...   

That said, please quit doing it, regardless of what imaginary pop-culture vendetta you're talking about. If you can't control making edits that do nothing but serve as a soapbox, go somewhere else. Otherwise, it's like someone who can't control their bladder going to a water park. It just causes problems.   """

EDcPL5Z6XX5IZoO,"Anti-Punk Ignorant 

The above user who commented that a user who removed info regarding the punk rock article is absolutely misguided. That user is me. I never once posted that alternative rock did not come from Punk. I suggest that you get your facts straight. What I said was, grunge is not punk. I have been a hard core punk and a neo-punk since 1979. Since the early '90's, I've been involved in trying to revive punk during the grunge period of the 90's decade (while separating ir from influences of grunge). 

I will be blunt and unapologetic again... Punk IS NOT grunge. Never has been and never will be. Obviously from your answer, you do not know anything about punk, its fashion, history, or its influences. Punk is a genre in and of itself. It didn't spring from anything known at the time it was born; it obviously didn't come from disco and it certainly was not influenced by hippy music. I should know, since I have almost 30 years experience as a punk, have conversed with the inner circle of the punk greats, and even made recommendations to them in the early 80's. 

This anti-punk clown therefore clearly does not know what he is talking about. He doesn't know anything even remotely relating to punk. He accused me of stating that punk did not come from alternative music. To correct you, I stated that punk IS NOT grunge. Don't make this same mistake again because it demonstates your low level of knowledge in this area and hugely dents your credibility. This shows that you do not like punk for some personal reason which wiki and I find very disturbing. Calm down. You are not correct in your statements."

How can it not be personal? Healthcare is about people's lives. Imagine if I was writing an article predominantly about the failings of allopathic medicine, of which there are still more than a few. Would it be a fair representation, and provide positive recommendations about the elements of allopathic medicine which could be trusted by those who may benefit from it? I am one of those people who has benefited from natural medicine in ways many GPs are still ill informed about. I had chronic hayfever that antihistamines could do little about without making me drowsy (I know they counteract it with stimulants now) due to boosting areas of my diet I rarely get a sniffle. Did a GP tell me about it? No. When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia I was given antipsychotic medication that stopped the voices, but induced symptoms of severe clinical depression and chronic fatigue which even the Psychiatrists who prescribed them failed to recognise as side-effects. Some time after when I told a state psychiatrist I was taking herbal medication he told me """"oh we're supposed to know about those sorts of things."""" There are also dietary changes that assist different mental illness which you won't get from many doctors. Now say I was a young lad again, and I was confronted with such ideas as you can't cure allergies with natural medicine, or that herbal medications are less effective. (A Joke. Some herbs are scheduled for a reason). Can you say that being discouraged from seeking the best qualified practitioner I could would be good for my health? Not that I'd go to wikipedia for that, at least not as anything more than an introductory paragraph or two and some further links. Call me naive, but I'd like to see a future where wikipedia can be relied upon as at least a good portal to reputable agencies, but there is no such place on wikipedia for Naturopathy in Australia, just as well in a way that the first two google searches, including the google definition of naturopathy come from the ANTA. Sure it'd be nice to have the first search as somewhere which offers a balanced critique, but no such place exists outside of reading long journal articles, and how many in the general public do that. Naturopathy is increasingly adopted by the general public in australia, you see it in mainstream pharmacies and in integrated medical practices now as well as health food shops and the call centres of vitamin companies. I'd prefer it to be the best quality possible, which is why I'm in favour of a critique of the more debatable therapies, and regulation which requires a high level of education. But nobody who's already interested in natural therapies is going to get much out of the wikipedia article as it is because they will see nothing but bias, and for people who are skeptical all it will do is agree with their skepticism. It challenges nobody, except the poor naturopathy student who wants it to be better.  """

While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you.

PS As for Grove, do you have another source which has corroborated Grove's statement.  His is the only paper on the Doji bara famine.  The Doji bara famine, moreover, predates any censuses of British India (which began in 1871).  His mortality statistics are based on methods that are conjectural and not rigorous.  Moreover, Grove is an environmental historian, not a historian of colonial India, and consequently, not able to assign political blame.  Is there any reference in the paper to the administration of British India?  Is there any evidence (by way of political culpability) in the paper to back up this one isolated sentence?  Cherry picking isolated sentences in the one and only paper on a topic (involving less than rigorous methods) is WP:UNDUE.  As Jimbo Wales himself says, """"If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.""""

 Edit Summary 

When editing an article on Wikipedia there is a small field labeled """"Edit summary"""" under the main edit-box. It looks like this: The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.

Filling in the edit summary field greatly helps your fellow contributors in understanding what you changed, so please always fill in the edit summary field, especially for big edits or when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.

It seems to me that Wiki's rules require that if there are criticisms of the subject of an article, and if those criticisms can be reliably sourced, they can be included in the article.

It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!"""

OXQpmzrKpoNgMW1,"I didn't initiate the attacks, just responded to them in turn. Calling them nuts was euphemistic. I could have called them turkeys as well. Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders. As I indicated in some of my edit summaries, rumor control, not hostile edit, just hostile to those determined to obscure data to save Church face. 71.102.18.173"
